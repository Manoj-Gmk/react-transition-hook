## React Smooth Search with useTransition

This React application demonstrates how to use the `useTransition` hook for non-blocking UI updates. It efficiently filters a large dataset (1000+ users) without freezing the UI, enhancing user experience.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase how React's `useTransition` hook can be used to build smoother, more responsive user interfaces — especially when working with large amounts of data. By deferring non-urgent updates like filtering, the app avoids lag and keeps the input field highly responsive during searches.

This is particularly useful in real-world applications where:
- Large lists need to be filtered or updated dynamically
- Smooth user experience is critical
- React 18 features like concurrent rendering are being explored
